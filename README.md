1. CCY encompasses everything that pertains to protecting our data, personal information, intellectual property etc. from theft and damage attempted by harmful hackers.

2. Cybersecurity's importance is on rise. Nowadays society is more technologically reliant than ever before and there is no sign that this trend will show.

3. Governments around the world are beginning more attention to cybercrimes. GPDR is a great example. It has increased the reputational damage of data breaches by forcing all organizations that operations that operate in the EU to:

* communicate data breaches
* Appoint a data-protection officer
* Require user consent to process information
* Anonymize data for privacy

4. The trend towards public disclosure is not limited to Europe. While there are no national laws overseeing data breach disclosure in the United States , there are data breach laws in all 50 states. Commonalities include:

* The requirement to notify those affect as soon as possible.
* Let the government know as soon as possible.
* pay some sort of fine.

5. This has driven standards boards like the National Institute of Standards and Technologies(NIST) to release frameworks to help organizations understand their security risks, improve cybersecurity measures and prevent cyber attacks.
